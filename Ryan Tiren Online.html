    <h3>Front-End Developer  •  User-Focused Designer  •  Hotshot Extraordinaire</h3>
    
    
    <p>I love building gorgeous websites with simple aesthetics, functional design, and code so organized it will make you weep with happiness. I live near Washington, DC and spend my free time dating my wife Sarah and wrestling our three kids. Take a look below to find out how and why I do what I do. Want to know more about me?

            <h2>USERS FOR LIFE</h2>
            <p class="box-text">At RedPeg Marketing I learned the importance of experiential marketing in connecting consumers to businesses. An extraordinary experience, physically or electronically, grips the user and draws them in. That’s why I champion user-focused websites; I want to dazzle visitors so that they love their “stay” and find exactly what they want. Engage the user and you engage a relationship!</p>
            
            <div id="box-3">
                <h2>RESPONSIBLY RESPONSIVE</h2>
                <p class="box-text">The teams I worked with each benefited from my drive to utilize the latest in technology to solve problems before they exist. And so I believe responsive design isn’t going out of style any time soon. If you have the privilege of building a new website, build it with the devices of 2025 in mind! If your website was built in 1995, retrofitting it with responsive design is a must. No site should be held back by the myriad of devices it might be viewed through.</p>

            <h2>WRITE AND WRONG</h2>
            <p class="box-text">Copy is king. …Okay, maybe that’s just my Humanities major talking. But well organized, to-the-point, impeccable text on your site is what keeps your visitors reading once they find you! Your website is the gateway to who you are and what you do – and first impressions are critical. I believe in exceptional writing and editing that demand not only a flourishing creative mind but a critical grammar fiend as well.</p>
            
            <div id="box-4">
                <h2>ODE TO CODE</h2>
                <p class="box-text">The world spins pretty fast these days, and to keep growing we need to keep changing. Allow your website the flexibility to be revised quickly and managed easily by your developer of either 15 years or 15 minutes. The CEOs at Arena Graphics, Inc. and Cars Supply Warehouse depended on my creative problem solving to keep the inner workings of their companies running smoothly, in house and online. That’s why I code the way I do. A slimmed down, systematic, overwhelmingly organized HTML/CSS infrastructure sets you up for success now AND later.</p>
